# Missile Parts Segmentation and Measurement (Computer Vision Model)

This repository contains a computer vision system developed during an internship project at **DRDO, Pune**. Focused on **segmenting missile parts** and **extracting dimensional measurements** from high-resolution images using deep learning and classical image processing.

## 🧠 Overview

The goal of this system is to:
- **Segment missile components** (e.g., nose, fins, body, tail) from full missile images using instance segmentation.
- **Accurately measure** part dimensions using edge-based post-processing techniques.

The model is built using **Detectron2's Mask R-CNN**, and post-processing is performed using **Canny edge detection** and **Convex Hull** algorithms to estimate part dimensions in pixel space.
